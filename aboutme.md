* Tenured Assistant Professor with _ius promovendi_ in the [Software Engineering and Technology cluster](https://set.win.tue.nl) of the department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)
* Extraordinary Associate Professor in [Computer Science](https://cs.sun.ac.za) at Stellenbosch University, South Africa.

# Academic background

I received _ius promovendi_ at TU/e in 2025, and tenure TU/e in 2021. I had previously re-joined TU/e in 2017 after some years elsewhere. From 2018--2023 I was Managing Director of the Institute for Programming research and Algorithmics ([IPA](https://ipa.win.tue.nl)), a Dutch national research school that is focused on PhD candidate education and for which TU/e is the coordinating university.

During 2014--2023, I was a research fellow at Stellenbosch University's [Department of Information Science](https://suinformatics.com). I have also spent time as a joint researcher between TU/e and ASML, working on model-driven hardware virtualizations for testing lithography systems. In 2016, I was a Visiting Scientist at TU Braunschweig, working on correctness-based approaches for software product line engineering, as well as extractive techniques for software product line engineering. That group since moved to Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), where I spent a sabbatical in 2022.

I have previously worked in industry in the Netherlands and the United States of America, and at the University of Pretoria, South Africa and Ume√• University, Sweden. 

I obtained both my MSc (cum laude) and doctorate in Computer Science and Engineering at TU/e.
