# Academic background

I obtained both my MSc (with honors) and doctorate in Computer Science and Engineering at TU/e. I have worked in industry in the Netherlands and the United States of America, and at the University of Pretoria, South Africa and Ume√• University, Sweden. I have also spent time as a joint researcher between TU Eindhoven and ASML, working on model-driven hardware virtualizations for testing lithography systems. In 2016, I was a Visiting Scientist at TU Braunschweig, working on correctness-based approaches for software product line engineering. I came back to TU/e and became Assistant Professor there in 2017. In 2018 I additionally became Managing Director of the Institute for Programming research and Algorithmics, a Dutch research school. In addition to my work at TU/e, I am a research fellow at Stellenbosch University, South Africa, working on joint research and supervising postgrad students.
