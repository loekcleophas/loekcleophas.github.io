# Academic background

I received tenure at TU/e in 2021. I had previously re-joined TU/e in 2017 after some years elsewhere. In 2018 I additionally became Managing Director of research school IPA, for which TU/e is the coordinating university.

Since 2014, I am a research fellow at Stellenbosch University. I have also spent time as a joint researcher between TU/e and ASML, working on model-driven hardware virtualizations for testing lithography systems. In 2016, I was a Visiting Scientist at TU Braunschweig, working on correctness-based approaches for software product line engineering, as well as extractive techniques for software product line engineering. That group since moved to Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), where I spent a sabbatical in 2022.

I have previously worked in industry in the Netherlands and the United States of America, and at the University of Pretoria, South Africa and Ume√• University, Sweden. 

I obtained both my MSc (with honors) and doctorate in Computer Science and Engineering at TU/e.
