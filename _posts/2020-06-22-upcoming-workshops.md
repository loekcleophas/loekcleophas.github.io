I'm involved in two upcoming workshops associated with the [Models 2020 conference](http://www.modelsconference.org): I'm a PC member for [ModComp 2020](http://www.es.mdh.se/ModComp/) on the interplay of model-driven and component-based software engineering and a co-organizer for [AMMoRE 2020](https://modelanalytics.wordpress.com/ammore20/) on analytics and mining of model repositories. Please consider submitting your research to these excellent events!
