After the disruption of the last two years, it was a pleasure to finally be able to address and hand over a degree certificate
to a Master student again.
MSc student Gijs Walravens gave his graduation presentation on March 24th, succesfully defending his MSc thesis
"Towards Digital Twins for soccer robots: a use case in reusing artifacts".
Gijs did his MSc final project as a graduation intern at TU/e, collaborating with [TechUnited](https://www.techunited.nl),
developing a digital shadow (as precursor to a digital twin) of TechUnited's soccer robots that compete in the
[RoboCup Middle Size League (MSL)](https://msl.robocup.org).
Abstract (and soon full thesis) can be found [here](https://research.tue.nl/en/studentTheses/towards-digital-twins-for-soccer-robots-a-use-case-in-reusing-art). 
You can watch my speech to Gijs (in Dutch) [here](https://youtu.be/1nTpSuVP7h4?t=9311).
