I got spotlighted by [the MDE Network](https://www.mde-network.org/), who interviewed me for a talk about my research interests around MDE and Digital Twins. Thanks Nuno Ferreira da Silva from the MDE Network for hosting, it was fun! Good community to join for those who are into MDE. My spotlight video is [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxBORLASvZ8&feature=youtu.be) as well as accessible through [the MDE Network community website](https://community.mde-network.org/).
