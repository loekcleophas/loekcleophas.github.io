Together with co-organizers Francis Bordeleau, Benoit Combemale, Romina Eramo, Mark van den Brand, Manuel Wimmer, and Andreas Wortmann, we had a very successful [1st International Workshop on Model-Driven Engineering of Digital Twins (ModDiT)](https://gemoc.org/events/moddit2021.html) as part of [Models 2021](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2021).

The workshop opened with a keynote on Modelling for and of Digital Twins by Bernhard Rumpe (RWTH), followed by six paper presentations and two invited talks/demos. It was attended by over thirty participants, and despite being held online, was a lively and inspiring event. Looking forward to a second edition in 2022, hopefully in person in Montreal, Canada!
