Together with my fellow Software Engineering Technology cluster member Jacob Krüger, and Formal Systems Analysis cluster member Clemens Dubslaff, I will organise the Meeting on Feature-Oriented Software Development (FOSD Meeting) 2024 at TU/e on April 9th–12th, 2024.

The FOSD Meeting is a yearly informal meeting to bring together the community of researchers working on feature-oriented software development, including e.g. product lines, software variability, configuration management, and software architecture. More details [on the event webpage](https://set.win.tue.nl/event/fosd-meeting-2024/).
