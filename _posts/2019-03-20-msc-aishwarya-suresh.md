MSc student Aishwarya Suresh gave her graduation presentation in December 2018, succesfully defending her MSc thesis
"Model analytics for ASML's data and control modeling languages".
Aishwarya did her MSc final project in collaboration with ASML, with joint supervision by Wilbert Alberts (ASML), Ã–nder Babur (TU/e) and myself.

The thesis can be found [here](https://research.tue.nl/en/studentTheses/model-analytics-for-asmls-data-and-control-modeling-languages).
