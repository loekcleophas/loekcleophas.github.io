Although the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA) got postponed from March to November due to the Coronavirus crisis, the proceedings have been published. The companion volume contains the New and Emerging Ideas (NEMI) track paper *Semi-automatic Architectural Suggestions for the Functional Safety of Cooperative Driving Systems* by my PhD student Sangeeth Kochanthara, former MSc student Niels Rood, myself, Yanja Dajsuren, and Mark van den Brand [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSA-C50368.2020.00018).

Sangeeth already prepared and recorded a presentation of the paper for presentation at ICSA (back when it was still supposed to happen in hybrid mode in Brazil in March) [which you can watch on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdkeWtumCJI).
