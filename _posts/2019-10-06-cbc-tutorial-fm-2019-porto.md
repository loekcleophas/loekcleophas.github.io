I'm looking forward to the next edition of the [tutorial on Correctness by Construction](https://github.com/TUBS-ISF/CorC/wiki/Tutorial-FM'19:-The-Correctness-by-Construction-Approach-to-Programming). I'll be co-presenting it in Porto, Portugal coming Thursday morning, as part of [FMWeek 2019](http://formalmethods2019.inesctec.pt). The tutorial is the latest and greatest edition of a series, with previous editions at FM'14, QRS'17, and ICTAC'18.
