# Open assignments and positions

I typically supervise students for Master's internship or graduation projects. A list of current (last updated June 2020) graduation project assignments can be found [here](https://assignments.win.tue.nl/search?q=cleophas). If you are interested in one of these, or want to discuss ideas for a different graduation project topic, please contact me.

I'm also interested in supervising doctoral students at TU/e, provided you either get self-funded via a grant, do a part-time PhD in combination with your job, or work on a project we have funding for.

<!-- At the moment (June 2020), we have [Two PhD positions on methodology and tool support for effective digital twinning](https://jobs.tue.nl/en/vacancy/two-phd-positions-on-methodology-and-tool-support-for-effective-digital-twinning-852762.html). -->


# Current postdocs and students

I currently (co-)supervise the following at TU/e and SU:

## Postdoctoral researchers

* (2020-) Gökhan Kahraman, postdoc at TU/e on the [ArrowHead Tools](https://arrowhead.eu/arrowheadtools) project.

## Doctoral students

* (2020–) Hossain Muctadir, PhD student at TU/e on model consistency as part of the [Digital Twin](https://www.digital-twin-research.nl) program.
* (2020–) David Manrique Negrin, PhD student at TU/e on model orchestration as part of the [Digital Twin](https://www.digital-twin-research.nl) program.
* (2017—) Sangeeth Kochanthara, PhD student at TU/e on (Software) Architecture and Functional Safety as part of the [i-CAVE](https://i-cave.nl) (integrated Cooperative Automated VEhicles) program.
* (2017–) Melanie Mauch, PhD student at SU on compressed pattern matching. Partially funded by NRF CPRR project "SaSy and DaPPR: Sequences and Syntax, Distributed & Parallel Pattern Recognition".

## Master's students

* (2021-2022) Bram van der Pol, MSc CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) student at TU/e on MSc final project with [Canon Production Printing](https://cpp.canon), working on models for model based carriage motion.
* (2022) Alexandre Janin, MSc EIT Digital ES (Embedded Systems) student at TU Berlin and TU/e on MSc final project with [Canon Production Printing](https://cpp.canon), working on model-based media handling for Canon’s cut-sheet printers.
* (2022) Ander Lee, MSc ES student at TU/e on MSc final project, investigating digital twin model integration and orchestration techniques by means of a microbrewery case study (_yes, you read that right---brewing beer for science_).
* (2022) Jingjing Wang, MSc ES student at TU/e on MSc final project.

# Previous students

A selection of students I (co-)supervised (mostly recently):

## Doctoral students

* (2021) Kousar Aslam, PhD student at TU/e on joint project with [ASML](https://www.asml.com), working on learning component models by using active automata learning techniques. Kousar is now [a postdoc at VU Amsterdam](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/kousar-aslam).
* (2019) Önder Babur, PhD student at TU/e. Thesis "Model analytics and management". Önder is now an assistant professor at [Wageningen University and Research](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/önder-babur) as well as guest at [TU/e](https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/önder-babur).
* (2017) Vreda Pieterse, PhD student at University of Pretoria. Thesis "Topic Maps for Specifying Algorithm Taxonomies: A Case Study using Transitive Closure Algorithms." Vreda has by now retired from University of Pretoria, but remains an active researcher; see [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vreda-Pieterse).

## Master's students

* (2022) Gijs Walravens, MSc CSE student at TU/e on graduation project with [TechUnited](https://www.techunited.nl), who developed a digital shadow (as precursor to a digital twin) of TechUnited's soccer robots that compete in the [RoboCup Middle Size League (MSL)](https://msl.robocup.org).
* (2021) Tajinder Singh, MSc AT (Automotive Technology) student at TU/e on MSc final project with Siemens, working in the area of Safety Systems for Connected Automated Vehicles.
* (2020) Javier Alvarez Morales, MSc ES (Embedded Systems) student at TU/e on MSc final project with [ASML](https://www.asml.com), working in the area of representing and handling variability in settings with heterogeneous models.
* (2019) Leon Freriks, MSc CSE student at TU/e on graduation project at [ASML](https://www.asml.com), "Using static analysis to improve scalability
of active automata learning of data-dependent components".
* (2019) Niels Rood, MSc CSE student at TU/e on "Functional Safety Analysis and Safety Pattern Application on i-CAVE", as part of the [i-CAVE](https://i-cave.nl) (integrated Cooperative Automated VEhicles) project.
* (2018) Aishwarya Suresh, MSc CSE student at TU/e on "Model analytics for ASML's data and control modeling languages".
