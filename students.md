# Interested?

If you're interested in doing a project or research degree under my supervision, please contact me.

I typically supervise Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) students for Master's internship and graduation projects, and Stellenbosch University (SU) students for Honours projects or research Master's or Doctoral degrees (self-funded, or with limited bursaries funded by the NRF or SU).

I'm also interested in supervising fulltime doctoral students at TU/e, provided funding is available—either from your side, or on a project we have funding for. At the moment (October 2019), we have an open [PhD position on product line engineering](https://jobs.tue.nl/en/vacancy/phd-position-on-product-line-engineering-744363.html).

# Current students

I currently (co-)supervise the following students at TU/e and SU:

## Doctoral students

* (2019–) Mahdi Saeedi Nikoo, PhD student at TU/e on the [ArrowHead Tools](https://arrowhead.eu/arrowheadtools) project.
* (2018–) Kousar Aslam, PhD student at TU/e on joint project with [ASML](https://www.asml.com), working on learning component models by using active automata learning techniques.
* (2017—) Sangeeth Kochanthara, PhD student at TU/e on (Software) Architecture and Functional Safety as part of the [i-CAVE](https://i-cave.nl) (integrated Cooperative Automated VEhicles) project.
* (2017–) Melanie Mauch, PhD student at SU on compressed pattern matching. Partially funded by NRF CPRR project "SaSy and DaPPR: Sequences and Syntax, Distributed & Parallel Pattern Recognition".

## Master's students

* (2019)	Javier Alvarez Morales, MSc ES (Embedded Systems) student at TU/e on internship project at [Spike Technologies](https://spike.global)
