# Interested?

If you're interested in doing a project or research degree under my supervision, please contact me.

## At TU/e

I typically supervise students for Master's internship or graduation projects. I'm also interested in supervising doctoral students at TU/e, provided you either get self-funded via a grant, do a part-time PhD in combination with your job, or work on a project we have funding for. At the moment (October 2019), we have an open [PhD position on product line engineering](https://jobs.tue.nl/en/vacancy/phd-position-on-product-line-engineering-744363.html).

# Current students

I currently (co-)supervise the following students at TU/e and SU:

## Doctoral students

* (2019–) Mahdi Saeedi Nikoo, PhD student at TU/e on the [ArrowHead Tools](https://arrowhead.eu/arrowheadtools) project.
* (2018–) Kousar Aslam, PhD student at TU/e on joint project with [ASML](https://www.asml.com), working on learning component models by using active automata learning techniques.
* (2017—) Sangeeth Kochanthara, PhD student at TU/e on (Software) Architecture and Functional Safety as part of the [i-CAVE](https://i-cave.nl) (integrated Cooperative Automated VEhicles) project.
* (2017–) Melanie Mauch, PhD student at SU on compressed pattern matching. Partially funded by NRF CPRR project "SaSy and DaPPR: Sequences and Syntax, Distributed & Parallel Pattern Recognition".

## Master's students

* (2019) Javier Alvarez Morales, MSc ES (Embedded Systems) student at TU/e on internship project at [Spike Technologies](https://spike.global)

# Previous students

A selection of students I (co-)supervised (mostly recently):

## Doctoral students

* (2019) Önder Babur, PhD student at TU/e. Thesis "Model analytics and management".
* (2017) Vreda Pieterse, PhD student at University of Pretoria. Thesis "Topic Maps for Specifying Algorithm Taxonomies: A Case Study using Transitive Closure Algorithms."

## Master's students

* (2019) Leon Freriks, MSc CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) student at TU/e on graduation project at [ASML](https://www.asml.com), "Using static analysis to improve scalability
of active automata learning of data-dependent components".
* (2019) Niels Rood, MSc CSE student at TU/e on "Functional Safety Analysis and Safety Pattern Application on i-CAVE", as part of the [i-CAVE](https://i-cave.nl) (integrated Cooperative Automated VEhicles) project.
