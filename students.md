* (2019–) Mahdi Saeedi Nikoo, PhD student at TU/e on the [ArrowHead Tools](https://arrowhead.eu/arrowheadtools) project.
* (2018–) Kousar Aslam, PhD student at TU/e on joint project with [ASML](https://www.asml.com), working on learning component models by using active automata learning techniques.
* (2017—) Sangeeth Kochanthara, PhD student at TU/e on (Software) Architecture and Functional Safety as part of the [i-CAVE](https://i-cave.nl) (integrated Cooperative Automated VEhicles) project.
* (2017–) Melanie Mauch, PhD student at SU on compressed pattern matching. Partially funded by NRF CPRR project "SaSy and DaPPR: Sequences and Syntax, Distributed & Parallel Pattern Recognition".

## Master's students
